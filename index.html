		<b>A little about me:</b> 
		I work as a project assistant under the supervision of <a href="https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~cmurthy/doku.php?id=home">Prof. Chandra R. Murthy</a> in the <a href="https://ece.iisc.ac.in/">Electrical Communication Engineering</a> department at the <a href="https://iisc.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Science</a>. I graduated from <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/">BITS Pilani</a>, India in 2020 with a BE degree in electrical and electronics engineering. My bachelor's thesis was supervised by Prof. Chandra.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Research summary:</b>
		My research centers around the impact of mobility on the performance of modern wireless technologies. Temporal variations in the channel response that arise due to moving users cause a disparity between the estimated channel and the true channel. This is known as <em>channel aging</em>. I aim to characterise the consequent drop in the achievable performance measure (per-user rate or sum rate) as a function of mobility.
	</p>

	<p>To date, I have analyzed the aforementioned problem in two key settings:</p>

	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Cell-free massive MIMO</b>: A distributed variant of cellular massive MIMO, cell-free massive MIMO offers higher coverage probability to users at the cost of increased backhaul. Currently, I am investigating the impact of channel aging and pilot contamination on the downlink performance of cell-free massive MIMO when (a) users learn the downlink channel using pilots transmitted by the APs. (b) users invoke knowledge of the channel statistics to decode the data symbols. This is a joint work with <a href="https://ribhuiitg.wordpress.com/">Prof. Ribhu Chopra</a> at IIT Guwahati and Prof. Chandra at IISc.
				<!-- At present, my focus is on cell-free massive MIMO, a distributed form of conventional massive MIMO. We study the aforementioned problem for different transmission protocols on the downlink. This is a joint work with <a href="https://ribhuiitg.wordpress.com/">Prof. Ribhu Chopra</a> at IIT Guwahati and Prof. Chandra at IISc. -->

				<b>OFDMA-based massive MIMO</b>: In orthogonal multiple access systems, mobility, by virtue of Doppler, brings another major impairment - inter subcarrier interference (ICI). In my bachelor's thesis, I looked at the joint effect of subcarrier allocation and user mobility on the uplink performance of massive MIMO-OFDMA systems for two receive combining schemes: maximal ratio (MR) and zero-forcing (ZF). We got a bunch of nice results, and <strike>wrote</strike> submitted a journal paper.

		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>I use tools from statistical signal processing, wireless communications and (a little bit of) information theory in my work.</p>
