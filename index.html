		<b>A little about me:</b> 
		I am an MS student in the <a href="https://www.ece.ucsd.edu/">ECE</a> department at <a href="https://ucsd.edu/">UCSD</a>, majoring in communication theory. Before this, I worked as a project assistant at <a href="https://iisc.ac.in/">IISc</a>, India with Prof. <a href="https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~cmurthy/doku.php?id=home">Chandra Murthy</a>. I graduated from <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/">BITS Pilani</a>, India in 2020 with a BE in electrical and electronics engineering.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Research summary:</b>
		My research at IISc focused on user mobility and its impact on the performance of multiple-antenna systems. Temporal variations in the channel response resulting from user movement cause a disparity between the estimated channel and the true channel. This is known as <em>channel aging</em>. I aimed to characterise the consequent drop in the achievable performance measure (per-user rate or sum rate) as a function of mobility.
	</p>

	<p>With my collaborators, I had explored the above problem in various settings which included:</p>

	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Cell-free massive MIMO</b>: Cell-free massive MIMO is a distributed variant of the cellular massive MIMO architecture offering higher coverage probability to users at the cost of increased backhaul. I looked at the impact of channel aging and pilot contamination on downlink cell-free and cellular massive MIMO systems. The goal was to understand the benefits of downlink training in both architectures in the context of user mobility. This work has been compiled and submitted to TCOM for review.
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				<b>OFDM-based massive MIMO</b>: In OFDM systems, the Doppler effect resulting from user mobility brings an additional impairment known as inter subcarrier interference (ICI). In my bachelor's thesis, I looked at the joint effect of subcarrier allocation and user mobility on the uplink performance of multi-user massive MIMO-OFDM systems, for two receive combining schemes: maximum-ratio (MR) and zero-forcing (ZF). We got a bunch of new results and published the work in TCOM.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>I used tools from statistical signal processing, wireless communications and (a little bit of) information theory in my work.</p>
