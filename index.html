		<b>A little about me:</b> 
		I am an MS student in the <a href="https://www.ece.ucsd.edu/>ECE</a> department at <a href="https://ucsd.edu/">UCSD</a>. Before this, I worked as a project assistant with <a href="https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~cmurthy/doku.php?id=home">Prof. Chandra Murthy</a> at <a href="https://iisc.ac.in/">IISc</a>. I graduated from <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/">BITS Pilani</a>, India in 2020 with a BEng in electrical and electronics engineering.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Research summary:</b>
		My research at IISc focused on user mobility and its impact on the performance of multiple-antenna systems. Temporal variations in the channel response resulting from user movement cause a disparity between the estimated channel and the true channel. This is known as <em>channel aging</em>. I aimed to characterise the consequent drop in the achievable performance measure (per-user rate or sum rate) as a function of mobility.

	<p>With my collaborators, I had explored the above problem in various settings which included:</p>

	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Cell-free massive MIMO</b>: Cell-free massive MIMO is a distributed variant of the cellular massive MIMO architecture offering higher coverage probability to users at the cost of increased backhaul. Currently, I am investigating the impact of channel aging and pilot contamination on the downlink performance of cell-free massive MIMO systems. This is a joint work with <a href="https://ribhuiitg.wordpress.com/">Prof. Ribhu Chopra</a> at IIT Guwahati and Prof. Chandra at IISc.
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				<b>OFDM-based massive MIMO</b>: In OFDM systems, the Doppler effect resulting from user mobility brings an additional impairment known as inter subcarrier interference (ICI). In my bachelor's thesis, I looked at the joint effect of subcarrier allocation and user mobility on the uplink performance of multi-user massive MIMO-OFDM systems, for two receive combining schemes: maximum-ratio (MR) and zero-forcing (ZF). We got a bunch of interesting results, and submitted a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05485">paper</a> in IEEE TCOM (under review).
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>I used tools from statistical signal processing, wireless communications and (a little bit of) information theory in my work.</p>
