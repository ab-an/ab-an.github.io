		<b>A little about me:</b> 
		I work as a research assistant under the supervision of <a href="https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~cmurthy/doku.php?id=home">Prof. Chandra R. Murthy</a> in the <a href="https://ece.iisc.ac.in/">Electrical Communication Engineering</a> department at the <a href="https://iisc.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Science</a>. I graduated from <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/">BITS Pilani</a>, India in 2020 with a BE degree in electrical and electronics engineering. My bachelor's thesis was supervised by Prof. Chandra.</p>

		<b>Research summary:</b>
		My research centers around the impact of user mobility on the performance of modern wireless technologies. Temporal variations in the channel response that arise due to moving users cause a disparity between the estimated channel and the true channel. This is known as <em>channel aging</em>. I aim to characterise the consequent drop in the achievable performance measure (per-user rate or sum rate) as a function of mobility. Two major settings that I have considered so far are:

		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Cell-free massive MIMO</b>: A distributed variant of cellular massive MIMO, cell-free massive MIMO offers higher coverage probability to users at the cost of increased backhaul. Currently, I am investigating the impact of channel aging and pilot contamination on the downlink performance of CF-mMIMO for two cases: (i) users learn the downlink channel using pilots sent by the APs. <br> (ii) users rely on long term channel statistics to decode the data symbols. This is a joint work with <a href="https://ribhuiitg.wordpress.com/">Prof. Ribhu Chopra</a> at IIT Guwahati and Prof. Chandra at IISc.
				<!-- At present, my focus is on cell-free massive MIMO, a distributed form of conventional massive MIMO. We study the aforementioned problem for different transmission protocols on the downlink. This is a joint work with <a href="https://ribhuiitg.wordpress.com/">Prof. Ribhu Chopra</a> at IIT Guwahati and Prof. Chandra at IISc. --> 
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>OFDMA-based massive MIMO</b>: In multicarrier systems that rely on orthogonality, mobility brings another major impairment - inter subcarrier interference (ICI). In my bachelor's thesis, I looked at the joint effect of subcarrier allocation and user mobility on the uplink performance of massive MIMO-OFDMA systems for two receive combining schemes: maximal ratio (MR) and zero-forcing (ZF). We got some nice results, and <strike>wrote</strike> submitted a journal paper.
			</li>
		</ul>
		My work entails using tools from statistical signal processing, wireless communications and (a little bit of) information theory.
